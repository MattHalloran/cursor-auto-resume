This is a placeholder for the demo screenshot image.

To add a proper screenshot:

1. Run the Cursor Auto Resume script
2. Take a screenshot showing the tool in action (with the indicator visible)
3. Name it "cursor-auto-resume-demo.png"
4. Replace this file with the screenshot

The screenshot will be displayed in the README.md file.
